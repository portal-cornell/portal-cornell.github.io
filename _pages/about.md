We are the **P**eople and **R**obots **T**eaching and **L**earning (PoRTaL) group at [Cornell Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/). 

We build everyday robots for everyday users. 

Our mission is to make robots accessible, user-friendly and practical for everyday tasks from cooking to cleaning. 
To this end, our research focuses on imitation learning, decision making and human-robot interaction.
We are passionate about both theory and algorithms that equip robots with skills to work with people.
<!-- Our mission is to enable robots to work seamlessly alongside human partners in the wild. -->
<!-- We focus on settings where a robot continually interacts with humans and its environment on domains such as collaborative mobile manipulation. -->
