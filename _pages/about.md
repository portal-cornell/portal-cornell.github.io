**P**eople and **R**obots **T**eaching and **L**earning (PoRTaL) group is part of [Cornell Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/).
Our mission is to enable robots to work seamlessly alongside human partners in the wild.
To this end, our work focuses on imitation learning, decision making and human-robot interaction. 
We are passionate about both theory and algorithms that equip robots with skills to work with people.
We focus on settings where a robot continually interacts with humans and its environment on domains such as collaborative mobile manipulation.
