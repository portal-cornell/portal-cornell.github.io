HAL aims to help humans automate daily tasks around the house. Since HAL is an apprentice, it can learn a new task, such as clean up after dinner, only from a few human demonstrations. HAL is also rumored to have an [evil twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000). 

## **D**extr**o**us **R**obot **A**pprentice (DORA)

*coming soon*

DORA aims to help humans do dextrous tasks, like cooking, assembly and crafts. DORA too is an apprentice and can learn quickly from demonstrations. Thankfully, no evil twins to worry about here!
