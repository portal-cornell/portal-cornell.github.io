Two amazing papers appearing at ICLR 2025! ðŸ˜Ž [SFM](https://arnavkj1995.github.io/SFM/) presents a non-adversarial approach for inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and can learn from state-only demonstrations. [Robotouille](https://portal-cornell.github.io/robotouille/) is a challenging benchmark that tests LLM agents synchronous and asynchronous planning capabilities through diverse long-horizon tasks and time delays.
