Proud to share two preprints! [muCode](https://portal-cornell.github.io/muCode/) presents a simple and scalable method for multi-turn code generation leveraging learned verifiers. [ORCA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05397) formulates rewards as an ordered coverage problem, enabling robots to learn from a single temporally misaligned video demonstration.
