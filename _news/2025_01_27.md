Two exciting papers at ICRA 2025! ðŸŽ‰ [RHyME](https://portal.cs.cornell.edu/rhyme/) enables robots to learn from human videos even when there are differences in execution gaps. [MotionTrack](https://portal.cs.cornell.edu/motion_track_policy/) presents a unified action space by representing actions as 2D trajectories on an image, enabling robots to directly imitate from cross-embodiment datasets.
