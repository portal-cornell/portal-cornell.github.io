Thrilled to share that a number of our works have been accepted to CoRL 2024, with two conference papers ([MOSAIC](https://portal-cornell.github.io/MOSAIC/) and [APRICOT](https://portal-cornell.github.io/apricot/)) and two workshop papers ([One-Shot Imitation under Mismatched Execution](https://portal.cs.cornell.edu/rhyme/) and 'Time Your Rewards')!

<!-- Two papers got accepted to CoRL 2024! [APRICOT](https://portal-cornell.github.io/apricot/) presents a novel algorithm that allows LLMs to interactively query users to reduce uncertainty, and [MOSAIC](https://portal-cornell.github.io/MOSAIC/) showcases a multi-robot system that leverages multiple foundation models to coordinate cooking with users! Two additional paper are presenting at workshops.
[RHyME](https://portal.cs.cornell.edu/rhyme/) enables robots to learn from human videos even when there are differences in execution gaps. Time Your Reward learns time-consistent rewards from a single video demonstration, levegeraging soft dynamic time warping.  -->
