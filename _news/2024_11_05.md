Two papers got accepted to CoRL 2024! [APRICOT](https://portal-cornell.github.io/apricot/) presents a novel algorithm that allows LLMs to interactively query users to reduce uncertainty, and [MOSAIC](https://portal-cornell.github.io/MOSAIC/) showcases a multi-robot system that leverages multiple foundation models to coordinate cooking with users! Two additional paper are presenting at workshops.
[RHyME](https://portal.cs.cornell.edu/rhyme/) enables robots to learn from human videos even when there are differences in execution gaps. Time Your Reward learns time-consistent rewards from a single video demonstration, levegeraging soft dynamic time warping.
